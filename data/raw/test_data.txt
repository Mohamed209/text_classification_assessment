Does anybody know if there are any good 2d-graphics packages  available for IBM RS/6000 & AIX ? I'm looking for something  like DEC's GKS or Hewlett-Packards Starbase, both of which  have reasonably good support for different output devices  like plotters, terminals, X etc.   I have tried also xgks from X11 distribution and IBM's implementation  of Phigs. Both of them work but we require more output devices  than just X-windows.   Our salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics and  I am..

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series can handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries (you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.  So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost one.  Best 73's

I agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC with a Quadra. I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called 8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though in a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...

The gl2p1.lzh stuff under gfx/show on the Aminet sites includes a  utility called pic2hl, that is a filter for HamLab that can handle  the most commonly used kinds of .PIC and .CLP files.   The biggest problem is that the .CLP files don't usually contain a  palette, so you need to convert a .PIC with the right palette  first (which creates a "ram:picpal" file), and then convert the  .CLP files.

Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d plane formed by the lines. Do an intersection calculation in the plane in 2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest. This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.  Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!  steve -

In certain Apple 13" RGB monitors there has been a problem with  the HIGH VOLTAGE CAPASITOR. Apple knows about this problem and is  replacing the cap at no cost if it falls into the bad batch that  they got from their supplier. Your local repair shop should know about  REPAIR EXTENSION 3L0218.
Sure. I can give is a shot...    You need to get the 30-pin simms.    If you mean in a "newer, more powerful" Mac system then the answer is no. Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the 72-pin SIMMs and no longer use the 30-pin SIMMs.

Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?  We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the system, and lets crash the Mac then.  Okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate errors in the 68000.

Normally, the "crash instance" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a..

Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing all over late-night TV recently? I was wondering if they use forced air, heat, or both. If there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at? My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay >$100.00 for a box, a fan and a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?
Hi,  I am looking for some help in choosing a package for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being  fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test the chip at speed on a PCB.

GEC/Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators (SL1454 etc) for use in satellite TV receivers : 150 or 600MHz in, 10MHz of baseband video out.

The most easily available components probably vary with local satellite standards, and I think the european systems vary rather widely from those in the US ..
Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes with Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.

You'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing in the new colours.  Use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).  Then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok.  You might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode.

The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above the minimally guaranteed figure.

You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter. Apple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or special memory chips. Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what kind of chips you need.
Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian, in his reply to my original posting. I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer, comp.graphics.hw_and_sw The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day. I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or  ..
If you use System 7, you can use my application Zing which has a 30 kB footprint (meaning you can have it running all the time without losing memory)  It is also compatible with the chat program "FishBomb" which allows sounds and pictures as well.  Both are, as far as I know, freeware (I dustribute Zing with source) and should be available on the normal services (mac.archive.umich.edu for instance)  Cheers,       / h+

I need the specs on various eprom data formats such as Intel Hex, Motorola S JEDEC etc.   Can anyone out there provide such info or a pointer to it? The one I want the most is Intel Hex.
Does anyone out there have any JPEG decompression code in pretty much any language that I can read and understand? I have trouble understanding the JPEG Group's code that I got from an FTP site. If any one can send me some good code, I will appreciate it a lot! Thanks!
On a related note, will the 1304 work on a Centris 650 with internal video and give the multiple resolutions?  This I'm VERY curious about...  Thanks!
Or, if you've got some entreprenuerial (sp?) spirit, get a cheapy clear plastic box, mount the simm inside, and sell it as a 'Pet SIMM'!  I'm sure there are *plenty* of suckers out there who would go for it!
I am looking at buying a low cost (< $500) scope for general purpose use. Any recommendations? Is this info in a faq somewhere? Any pointers appreciated. Thanks,  -Gerard.

The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs. I've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal bug has crept into their more recent s/w. The bug only shows up during heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system (MacsBug can not reboot, time to hit the restart button).  AE told me in January that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug which I described to them. Since then they have not answered any of my faxes asking them for..
There are several public domain utilities available at your usual archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl file, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp. The problem  is that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of  the many pd format converters I have used. Any hint welcome! Let me know if you have problems locating the utilities. Hope it helps.
Hi ... Recently I found XV for MS-DOS in a subdirectory of GNU-CC (GNUISH). I  use frequently XV on a Sun Spark Station 1 and I never had problems, but when I start it on my computer with -h option, it display the help menu and when I start it with a GIF-File my Hard disk turns 2 or 3 seconds and the prompt come back.

Why not use the PD C library for reading/writing TIFF files? It took me a good 20 minutes to start using them in your own app.  Martin  - -
I'm sure it is, and I am not amused. Every time I read that part of the TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their "arbitrary but carefully chosen number" is neither. Additionally, I find their choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why not just use the letters "TIFF"?  (And no, I don't think they should have bothered to support both word orders either- and I've found that many TIFF readers actuall..
I hear that the Performa 450 is really an LCIII with an internal modem. Can the modem part be obtained and installed in an LCIII? It would be nice if it were actually a powerbook internal modem, but that might be too much to hope for.

I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz). I have tried clocking my FPU at 28 to 50 MHz and it all worked just fine. I have a MC68030-33 CPU. I don't know why my FPU has an XC (my original 33MHz FPU was label MC68882-33), but it seems to work fine on my system. Maybe you just have a bad chip.  Stefan
I want to be able to take a bunch of home-made songs (from DAT or other  suitable master) and output them to a short run (10-20 off) of standard  music CDs. Would one of the CD recorders designed for writeable CD ROMs work  for this purpose? Alternatively, is there a service that does this sort of  thing for a fee?   I'm after as much information as possible on the alternatives (cost, lead  time, equipment required, procedure to follow, etc.) Email replies would be  appreciated.

A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days. I had the pleasure of doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH. Now if you go a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of it. (If you speedo doesn't burn out.) Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile odometer would take 22 days or so. Much easier just to take the speedo apart.  Thought I'd share. BTW, all this info was obtaine..

Hey, now will you stop encouraging him? Copy protection only serves one pur- pose: to keep the honest buyer from making (legal) backup copies. It will definitely not stop any pirates.

It seems that the ubiquitous camera flash circuit is what I want, but I cant get mine apart without breaking it. I would appreciate receiving the circuit description or a source of one. I have already looked in several electronics circuits ha..
Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL? Standby-drain specs for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down to zero or all the way up to Vcc. TTL isn't good at doing the former and it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors. This sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable factor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't all the way hard OFF.
It's not what they did that matters. It's what *you* do and what *I* do and what *we* do in response that matters. Do we lessen ourselves by killing in response to killing? It's vengeance.

It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business  or for an illegal use. Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor.   The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed. The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not. A lot of state courts ..
I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now. I must say this machine is really fast! The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm.  However, I still have a few complaints: - when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop  pattern) jerks up and down for a few times. - the Quantum 170 drive is noisy  Overall, I highly recommend it: it is fast, affordable and looks great!  -
It seems to deter those who are executed from future criminal activity.   Why don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes? Blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal system, blacks would be disproportionately represented.  (Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing. It's probably an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks are more likely to be poor. The way to reduce the proportion of minorities in..
The DEA and other organizations would have the American people believe that we are winning the "war on drugs".

Hi,  I've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes positioned carefully) to a .3DS file that when you reload it after restarting 3DS, they are given a default position and orientation. But if you save to a .PRJ file their positions/orientation are preserved. Does anyone know why this information is not stored in the .3DS file? Nothing is explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the .PRJ file.  I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information,..
So, will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade, or will it  require a logic board swap?

To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:  A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown qu..

Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp out level signals? Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact bounce? How are you driving the relays? TTL gate output? Switching transistor? How are the relays connected to what you are driving?
The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX.

Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do. A continuous conductor is a good  electrostatic shield. Do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things? This shielding won't do much good for magnetic fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded, like a Faraday cage.

Welcome to the conservative judiciary.   I think Scalia's point was that you get one chance. If new information comes out later, tough.

An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the balanced low-Z output, but this solution does not provide any galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and mixer. If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap, crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated, the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (It is cheap...somewhat $10/DI-box). Not sure, but Craig Anderton did introduce one DI-box project in Guitar Player mag years..

I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner. It came with scanning/editing software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al. The scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale. It also has dithered and line art settings when grayscale isn't desired. Great scanning software, easy to use. I frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image in the note. Hope this helps!
Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:   I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is a  little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. Then I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with my Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the s..

Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the original poster, BTW.

Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed ..

All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my Mac Plus and my Powerbook 140. It was for this reason I assumed the problem had something to do with the Quadra. Even with the Quadra, they mostly worked OK. The problem occurred when I ejected a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes saying "This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware" even though there was no cartridge in the drive.
The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the "B" word, or the "H" word, or even the "N" or "W" words. It is the "L" word - LOSER !!   That's right.

Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then (wouldn't y..

I was a graduate student in the early 1980s, and we had a conference on  Reaganomics where Jerry Jordan, then a member of the Council of Economic  Advisors, was a speaker.

I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines.

What is happening is this: 1) You turn the TV on. 2) The horizontal output begins normal operation. This powers up the  high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry. 3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down. 4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.
The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed.  I don't believe the button un-dims, since there's nothing to select. I haven't tracked down a Centris to check this on though.   Yup, I made the same mistake several months ago when this issue came up before :-)   noah

For some reason I never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC, you really can't go past the mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs.

G'day all,  Can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/ display HDF image files ? I've had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA  and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage approaches and minimalist documentation :-)  Part of the problem is that I want to look at large (5MB+) HDF files and crop out a section. Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped pa..
I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25" mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?  Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.  Third, I have got the drive to forma..

I've just installed a 5.25" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues are the same. So, to answer your questions...    You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers. Put it at a convenient number like "1". You *could* cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the hassle? You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of your internal drive.   Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned too. But it's no ..

Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM expansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion, giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling TechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc....

If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the problem there is now. Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.  Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.) This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections. Well, the aid didn't come through and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining st..

I believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse, you must remove the label on the bottom that says "Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II" There you should find two screws on either side.

The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi.

The Republicans are, in general, fighting any tax increase. There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase incrementally.   (BTW, what is different between Canada's tax and most of Europe's that makes it "visible?")    This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congress enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that. (Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd  have a difficult time "forcing" anything like that.)    Primarily because..
Might be a good idea... The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that. It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD. Digital Domain ? There are possibly other low THD sources) Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spe..

Ok, so your a HAM. Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz. These numbers sound  like some you have herd before? Thats right, you guessed it, they are  common IF numbers. Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s) which generates an IF. This is what your detector detector is detecting (the local oscillator).
I need the file format for cc:Mail file formats - it seems to be PCX-based, but with a twist: only the first page of a multi-page fax will come out readable. The other pages disappear. The format seems to be 'proprietary'.  Anybody got any clues? I have to give my email FAXes to my secretary in order to get 'em unscrambled. I want a filter from cc:Mail to .p[nb]m.  Come to think of it, p[nb]m to cc:Mail would be nice too.

Shure it is temperature dependent, but this does not clean all your problems. Based on some exp. I must say that the connections between the power supply and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the last phase (lower Voltage).

Hi,  The subject line says it all. My system acts weird at times. All of a sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.  This was a really big problem for a while.

The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not necessarily rectangular) as a window. My problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons" from the first one. Is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon??? Is there a simpler way??  Comments welcome.

If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.

Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for $649. After two months, the drive started having problems.

So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Someti..

I had the same problem with my 512 a long time ago. Resoldering the joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it. Turns out that continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped) cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video circuitry off.

We should normally see an echo on A that corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A; we can see a v..
We'll let you live, but just this once....  There's more to a real "storage" scope than just a long-persistence phosphor. Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all; what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor, which becomes charged as the electron beam intially "writes" the trace. With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level "flood" electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the "wri..

From the benchmarks I've seen (was that in MacUser or MacWeek?) the FPU-less Centris 610 is _faster_ at floating-point operations (the kind of calculations that get routed to an FPU) than a Mac IIfx!  And a Mac IIfx (68030 @ 40MHz + FPU) is _the_ fastest 030-based Mac.  Take note, of course, that benchmarks never tell the whole story... Get your favorite program(s) and run them on both machines at the store. They should let you do that before you plunk down a hefty amount...  Virtually, Philippe

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of doing this. I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.

I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics. Anyone else feel this way? Just curious.
Evidence given for her prostitute status, besides the admittedly  questionable claim of the man on trial included:  1.

Not enough to convict her, but enough to create reasonable doubt whether a rape actually took place, or theft of se..

Geez, where have you been, Ryan? I proposed this theory *months* ago. Let's take it one step further, even.

Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or, more accurate..
I was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a 48-bit graphics computer/image processing system. I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that. Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel. That's 60 bits of info-what could that possibly be for?

No, it is independent of the speedometer. The gun processes two doppler returns-the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed of the target, taking the difference between the two. Some guns with a "moving mode" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed preferentially at the pavement.  Car and Driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in 1985. I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus radar-measured ticket. It detailed "moving mode," ..
