_ _  Then why do we really need national health insurance then? Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.   Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans..	3
es: .C  Excuse me for sticking my nose in, but any parent/parents who do not allready  immunize their children (especially if it is already free), don't deserve one  frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves, or public health  care service.  (I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are  slightly seperate issues, but anybody who wouldn't help their kids, don't  deserve my tax help).	3

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.	0

Uh oh...  Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes. Some involve modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.

I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case. (They were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips). Immediately after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an "Objection!" heard in the background. The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the objection was upheld.

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry - wrong. It would be an extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat.

And who's advocating that? Hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations of the acts. Just like premeditated homicide is treated stricter than heat-of-passion homicide.

For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very* bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e. stage must not get too hot).

Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least) all had wirewrapped backplanes. Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.

Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen conn..	2
The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:  "A gram of this dye costs a dollar. It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar. And if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar."  I.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering it to you - the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct that cost almost nothing intrinsically.	2

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get). My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.  Good UV ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs. I'd proceed by getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.	2

This algorithm works well for me:  Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals: - First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.

Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE. Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face. And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting ..	0

Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially documented by Apple). Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.

Would you please define "nth derivative of debt"? Last time I asked you seem to have disappeared....   And it's the deficits themselves that came down to 2.9% of GNP. The numbers are posted in the previous posting.    Cute, Paul, but with no numbers you still look foolish.    Paul, like many others, is confusing the deficit with the debt.

One of the commentators on one of the Big Three news programs  described the VAT (which ain't a sales tax) as a tax "government's love."

You pay far more for automobile taxes than most people realize because it's contained in two dozen different taxes, everything from your license to your tires to your gasoline.	3

I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?  Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft), and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.  How about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting ridiculous?  What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?  Sorry if I'm "mucking up" the network with one o..	2

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly, a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state, according to the inputs.  A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are three inputs required.  A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable inpu..	2

On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines. It measures  the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with  5v, it reg's 5v. Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish  to lower it via a resistor. The sensitivity of the board is so great  that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch  the probe and it will register the full input voltage. A 1m resistor  only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable.     What could the prob..	2

My impression - it's not an area I've played with much - is that the much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete. If you want to detect a 1kHz tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end. The NE567 was what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays they're easy, and the results are better.	2

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient.  AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases you are not interested in the DC level. My pre ampli..	1

With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to pay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect that the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American shadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the control of the domineering wife..	3

I use an H11F1 FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals. There is no click, since I put a .1uF cap across the LED. Distortion measurement are very low with mic level, and they went up to 0.03% at a + 14 dB line level. All I did was put the FET in series with one leg of the balanced line. No hums, pops, just audio jumping out of silence. The FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150-200 ohms with it on.	2

I would appreciate some help in locating a telephone controlled power bar for my PC. The unit would power up the PC when the telephone rings and keep it up as long as the telephone connection is present.  I also need to be able to power up this same PC through the use of an external timer. I can supply power or a contact closure to do this.  I will summarize and post the results of this query here.  Thank you.	2

I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling components. For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other. Reverse the current and you reverse the effect. I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power..	2

BUT... If you are in the habit of trying to repair old and obsolete machines, the old data books are a goldmine of information you can not get anywhere else. If you are trying to find a modern replacement for an obsolete part, the original specs really come in handy. Design out of the new books but save the old ones (or donate them to a ham).  If anybody in Phoenix disagrees, I'll drive over and help them 'get rid' of all their old data books.	2

What do you mean by "police band" - there is no such thing.  Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.

Agreed.    It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams. Just as Marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human condition.   This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds. In this case, "limited" and "big" government are not define..	3

Undoubtedly. In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and  undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.

Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.

Sometimes. It depends on your monitor and your timing. If you don't have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can get even/odd tearing at the top of the screen, which is very sensitive to the HHOLD control. It looks like what you would expect if you scanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube.  With proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock solid.	2

I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting).

Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large capacity devices. The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge it. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room for expansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25", a 3.5", a tape drive, and a MO drive, all on the floppy interface. The possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous).	1

[3] When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF? [4] How well does JPEG compress images? [5] What are good "quality" settings for JPEG? [6] Where can..	0
I was not discussing "universal" definitions in this post, Mark. Please refrain from dragging in irrelevancies.  Do you agree with my statement above about physicians being unqualified if they can't determine viability?   And that's good enough for the law, Mark. So why do you keep whining that viability "isn't defined"? What purpose does your whining serve?	3
: >True, man did not invent the need for food, shelter, warmth and the ilk, : >but man did invent the property laws and the laws of trespass.  : But how do you think property is generated ? Does it grow automatically : on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?  Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris. In either case, the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of year..	3

Oddly enough, you don't, at least according to the wiring FAQ that is regularly posted on misc.consumers.house.  A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents, and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found. No ground connection is needed for it to function.	2

I think there is a huge difference in the materials and  process for printer/toner PCB's. I get first time, everytime results from a local HP Postscript, and hardly ever works from copies of the same artwork. The printer results are so good that I have quit even looking for PC board processes. If I had to use the copier version, I would think I would look elsewhere. The moral? Experiment and find what works. Toner transfer CAN give excellent results. It, like any process, gives erratic  results ..	2

Which, considering the amount Bush&congress added to it, would be a not-inconsiderable achievement.  While we're on the subject, I also believe that the supply-side claim that reducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in SocSec taxes, which were *raised* a considerable amount, at the same time that income taxes were cut. If you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after after the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. By then, record deficits were..	3
Also, if someone would recommend another  Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus. I believe it is the best solution because of the performance and price. Why spend $800 upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225. It speeds up the internal clock speed to 16MHz. That may not seem like much but it also speeds up SCSI transfers. I think that feature is unique to brainstorm. Check it out.	1
In the UIBM PC world, how much of a "standard" has VESA become for SVGA graphics?

Dear Netters I want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer.  Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each running person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred  meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is about 150MHz and about 440MHz. To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best  the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather  specialized I do not expect to be able to buy th..	2
Hello-  I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that it proudly proclaims "8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING" on the box. Now while I think I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete "samples" exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor), I don't understand this "8 TIMES" business...

Ahhh, the classic Truth By Blatant Assertion technique. Too bad it's so demonstrably false. Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a  nice history on drug criminalization. The evidence there shows that during periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime went up and people did die from bad drugs. During times when drugs were legalized, those trends were reversed.   Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof. Gosh, I'm convinced. ( :-} for the humor impaired). First, as..	3

There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time  _alone_ would cause an incompatibility. There would have to be another  difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.

Imprecise. This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires. Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the ..	2

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT. Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST -  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).  The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit. Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a man..	3

I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general. The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose.

Actually, what the study shows is that 2 percent of the men surveyed *said* they engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent *said* they  considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

Hello all!  For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.

This can be caused by two one of two things. The first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or other electrical device.

Hi,   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx  260vDV.

The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.

No one is questioning whether Mr. King is black. The question arises whether King's race should make police officers "afraid as hell." Your statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for large black guys than for just large guys in general.   That two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use.	3

IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAERE TYPIST PLUS GRAPHICS  HAND SCANNER, PLEASE READ ON AND SAVE MY LIFE.........  My problem is that my Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will not connect to my PowerBook 160.  The cable from the scanner will not fit the SCSI port of the computer.   I managed to gaet a cabled assembled that adapted the cord to the computer. However, this placed the computer into SCSI mode, that is it acted as an external hard disk whenever i switched the computer on.  I've ..	1

I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately). Previously a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly. Now the systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for the presence/type of FPU. When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work. The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor o..	2
I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the price of the C650 is going to drop this year. This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August. My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month. I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the res..	1
Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by  today's standards. If you have an idea about its voltage and current  ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with  anything with better specs. Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating  of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely "ON"  at +10VDC. Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious - they're more or  less voltage controlled current sources. If the MOS..	2
I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect. There is a "reasonable use" exemption for *copyright*. There is none for *patents*. The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work is exempt but personal use is not. That is, it's okay to experiment with a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your stereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.  Of course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be dete..	2
True (especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature).     Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice while wearing the watch on one's wrist). Low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more battery power.    Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they are more power-stingy than suitable crystal o..	2

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

The more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing the EPROM arra..	2

(ie: must have 40pnt definition to print a 10pnt font) When I upgraded, I talked to Orange Micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely works with System7. However, the upgrade was US$40, so I passed.  Hope this helps?  <marc>  -	1

For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk. I've got a Computer Engineering degree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually use. Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were $7000/year lower!

Probably, law enforcement people (Park Service Police and D.C. cops), who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the density of the crowd in small regions.

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car. They work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out. Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.	2

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works. A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals. These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc. The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already). It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number o..	2

As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts. The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit. In high impedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit. Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs a..	2

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other postings "near UV light" /is/ "actual UV light."

That is in fact the current version (it only came out in December).   My test movie was created at 320*240 resolution, it wasn't being scaled up. Scaling was a very CPU-intensive operation with the original QuickTime (1.0); the current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -> 320*240), but even so, I'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as with playing back an actual 320*240 movie. I haven't done any numerical measurements for scaled playback.	0

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded with the proper software.

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a "character" containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt. This means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.

Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling-water reactor nuclear plants. (There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).

This doesn't sound right to me. Don't Quadras use the 53C96? If so, the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing. That's all handled by the chip. About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96. That, however, should only really hurt synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.  Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra. On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the Mac wa..	1

Fine. Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion. The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.   For example, does "non-initiated force" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisione..	3

I want to convert a 500 Volt sinewave with frequency between 1 kHz and 10 kHz, to a 10 Volt sinewave with the same frequency, by means of a transformer. The secondary current will be .6 A (600 mA).

What core do I use, how big must it be in order not to saturate, what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.?  I know little about an..	2
Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable.

Hello, I purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously  Speedstar 24 compatible. Its name is "VGA 4000 TrueColor". It is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE, XMODE and at least one more MODE, as well as some drivers for Lotus, Windows, etc. Only one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode, namely the Windows 3.1 driver. Nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode. Some articles in this group about the Speedst..	0

While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here, he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.   Mach banding will occur for any image. It is not the color quantization you see when you don't have enough bits. It is the human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities. The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on the brighter side and darker on the darker side.  -Andre	0
Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup.

The key word is `spilled'. If semen was spilled anywhere where there was a chance of procreation it was OK. If it was spilt on the ground or in to a man it was a big sin, ditto with animals. The jews said sex=pro- creation.  Homosexuals didn't breed, there fore they are evil and should be stoned to death.      Stoning non-breeding population was fine. Only the breeders were considered to be worth much.    Xavier	3

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for easier cleaning.  If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the new ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at the guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw heads.	1
Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests. As a  left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto dealers.

Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company. The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise. The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.  In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral. For 99.9% of the things you can plug into one of these, they work fine. For our cash registers they were a nig..	2

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent toner, like HP's "Microfine" stuff) don't.

On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much worse than a bubblejet. :-)  One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are Bu..	2
The Atari 2600 used a 6502 CPU, just like their entire 8-bit line (400, 800,1200,1400, 1440, 130xe, 65xe computers, as well as the 5200 game machine). The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.

Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part because of TIMING considerations. A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay. The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can..	2

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity me..	1

Does anyone know if such program is available ? Thanks for any help !!	0
I have a small program to extract a 640x480 image from a vga 16 color screen, and store that image in a TIFF file. I need to insert the image into a sales brochure, which I then need printed in 4 color.

However, I don't have a mac, but I do have windows. What would I need to  do this type of operation in the windows 3.1 envi..	0
I'm planning to buy a new VLB/EISA system with a good graphic performance. So far I looked at the ATI GUP VLB as my favorite graphics-card. But  recently I heard something about a new card from Miro. It was the Miro Crystal 24s with 3 MB and True Color support up to 1024x768. It costs just a little more than the ATI. So, can't decide which one matches better my needs. Any technical references and performance comparisons (especially from the Miro card) would be greatly appreciated.  -Peter-  E-Ma..	0

I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video in my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13" monitor. What's the deal on them?  1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max and min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?  2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?  3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What bit depths are accelerate..	1

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory access).  -  Ravikumar Venkateswar rvenkate@uiuc.edu	1

Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside, outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the pol..	0

You are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on TV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately). Of course, the phrase "TV screen" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates. Might even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).	2

There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure ..	0
The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft, exploiting the venturi effect. Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers. Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser in the plant, is sprayed over louvres. The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection. The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation.  It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are ..	2

Up until last week, I have been running POVray v1.0 on my 486/33 under DOS5 without any major problems.

To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers. Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks. If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of ..	1

A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the plane (it may require you to give it a "cut" though...)
